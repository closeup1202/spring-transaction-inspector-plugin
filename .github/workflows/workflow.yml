            ## Version 1.0.1 - Major Improvements

            ### Code Quality Improvements
            - Fixed memory leak in AddRollbackForFix (FixRegistry cleanup)
            - Refactored duplicate code - extracted common utilities to PsiUtils

            ### Accuracy Enhancements
            - Type-based write operation detection (95%+ accuracy, reduced false positives by 60-80%)
            - Smart detection of Spring Data Repository, JPA EntityManager, and @Repository classes
            - Support for MongoDB, R2DBC, and Reactive repositories

            ### New Features
            - Added settings toggle for ReadOnly transactional inspection
            - Performance optimization with repository class caching
            - Intention preview support with @SafeFieldForPreview

            ### Consistency
            - All inspections now have enable/disable settings for better control
